AttachmentGrid
=========================

## Overview
This is a Rally SDK 1.x app that generates a grid list of Stories, Test Cases, Defects, or Tasks, a few fields, and their attachments. The ID and attachments are link you can navigate. I will only list items following your project hierarchy selections. The output grid is basic HTML which allows cut-and-paste into emails, docs, etc.
